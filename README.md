Jet is a server + clients library to interact/use jetty9 from clojure
using core.async channels.

Main goals are to be *lightweight*, *fast*, and *easy to use*.

## What's in the box?

* **ring adapter** running on jetty9

* **Websocket Server** with a simple yet powerful api based on core.async

* **WebSocket Client** sharing the same principles/api than the WebSocket
  server handlers

* **Asynchronous HTTP Client** with streaming support (yet to come,
  it's incomplete still)

The server part started from the code of the various
`ring-jetty9-adapters` out there.

In the current state the server is fairly complete/stable, the
websocket client nearly 100%, the HTTP client still at early stages.

What it will be able to do once complete:
SPDY support, tons of options, ...

The API is still subject to changes.

## Documentation

[codox generated documentation](http://mpenet.github.io/jet/).

## Installation

jet is [available on Clojars](https://clojars.org/cc.qbits/jet).

Add this to your dependencies:

```clojure
[cc.qbits/jet "0.3.0-beta1"]
```
## Examples

### WebSocket

Here we have the equivalent of a call to run-jetty, with the first
param as your main app ring handler (coming from whatever routing lib
you might use).

In the options the `:websockets` value takes a map of path to
handlers.

The websocket handlers receive a map that hold 3 core.async channels
and the underlying WebSocketAdapter instance for potential advanced uses.

* `ctrl` will receive status messages such as `[::connect this]`
`[::error e]` `[::close reason]`

* `in` will receive content sent by this connected client

* `out` will allow you to push content to this connected client and
  close the socket


An example with a little PING/PONG between client and server:

```clojure
(use 'qbits.jet.server)

;; Simple ping/pong server, will wait for PING, reply PONG and close connection
(run-jetty some-ring-handler
  {:port 8013
   :websockets {"/"
                (fn [{:keys [in out ctrl ws]
                      :as opts}]
                    (async/go
                      (when (= "PING" (async/<! in))
                        (async/>! out "PONG")
                        (async/close! out))))}})
```

The websocket client is used the same way

```clojure
(use 'qbits.jet.client.websocket)

;; Simple PING client to our server, sends PING, waits for PONG and
;; closes the connection
(connect! "ws://localhost:8013/"
          (fn [{:keys [in out ctrl ws]}]
            (async/go
              (async/>! out "PING")
              (when (= "PONG" (async/<! in))
                (async/close! out))))))
```

If you close the :out channel, the socket will be closed, this is true
for both client/server modes.


### HTTP Client

The API is nearly identical to clj-http and other clients for
clojure. One of the major difference is that calls to the client
return a channel that will receive the eventual response
asynchronously.  The response is then a fairly standard ring response
map, except the body, which is also a core.async channel (potential
streaming/chunked response support in the future).

See the docs for details,
[HTTP client API docs](http://mpenet.github.io/jet/qbits.jet.client.http.html)
[`qbits.jet.client.http/request`](http://mpenet.github.io/jet/qbits.jet.client.http.html#var-request)
in particular gives an idea of the format.


```clojure
(use 'qbits.jet.client.http)
(use 'clojure.core.async)

;; returns a chan
(http/get "http://graph.facebook.com/zuck")
user> #<ManyToManyChannel clojure.core.async.impl.channels.ManyToManyChannel@731db933>

;; block for the response
(<!! (http/get "http://graph.facebook.com/zuck"))

user> #qbits.jet.client.http.Response{:status 200, :headers {"content-type" "text/javascript; charset=UTF-8", "access-control-allow-origin" "*", "content-length" "173", "facebook-api-version" "v1.0", "connection" "keep-alive", "pragma" "no-cache", "expires" "Sat, 01 Jan 2000 00:00:00 GMT", "x-fb-rev" "1358170", "etag" "\"3becf5f2bb7ec39daa6bb65345d40b9f4b1db483\"", "date" "Wed, 06 Aug 2014 15:43:19 GMT", "cache-control" "private, no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate"}, :body #<ManyToManyChannel clojure.core.async.impl.channels.ManyToManyChannel@5a278fe0>}


;; get to the body
(-> (http/get "http://graph.facebook.com/zuck")
    <!!
    :body
    <!!)
"{\"id\":\"4\",\"first_name\":\"Mark\",\"gender\":\"male\",\"last_name\":\"Zuckerberg\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/www.facebook.com\\/zuck\",\"locale\":\"en_US\",\"name\":\"Mark Zuckerberg\",\"username\":\"zuck\"}"

;; autodecode the body
(-> (get "http://graph.facebook.com/zuck" {:as :json})
         async/<!!
         :body
         async/<!!)
{:id "4", :first_name "Mark", :gender "male", :last_name "Zuckerberg", :link "https://www.facebook.com/zuck", :locale "en_US", :name "Mark Zuckerberg", :username "zuck"}

;; POST
(post "http://foo.com" {:form-params {:foo "bar :baz 1}})
```

And you can image (or read the api doc) how `post`, `put`, `delete`
and other methods work. It's fairly standard.
