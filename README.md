Jet is a server + clients library to interact/use jetty9 from clojure
using core.async channels.

## What's in the box?

* **ring adapter** running on jetty9

* **Websocket Server** with a simple yet powerful api based on core.async

* **WebSocket Client** sharing the same principles/api than the WebSocket
  server handlers

* **Asynchronous HTTP Client** with streaming support (yet to come,
  it's incomplete still)

The server part started from the code of the various
`ring-jetty9-adapters` out there.

In the current state the server is fairly complete/stable, the
websocket client nearly 100%, the HTTP client still at early stages.

What it will be able to do once complete:
SPDY support, tons of options, ...

The API is still subject to changes.

## Documentation

[codox generated documentation](http://mpenet.github.io/jet/).

## Installation

jet is [available on Clojars](https://clojars.org/cc.qbits/jet).

Add this to your dependencies:

```clojure
[cc.qbits/jet "0.3.0-beta2"]
```
## Examples

### WebSocket

Here we have the equivalent of a call to run-jetty, with the first
param as your main app ring handler (coming from whatever routing lib
you might use).

In the options the `:websockets` value takes a map of path to
handlers.

The websocket handlers receive a map that hold 3 core.async channels
and the underlying WebSocketAdapter instance for potential advanced uses.

* `ctrl` will receive status messages such as `[::connect this]`
`[::error e]` `[::close reason]`

* `in` will receive content sent by this connected client

* `out` will allow you to push content to this connected client and
  close the socket


An example with a little PING/PONG between client and server:

```clojure
(use 'qbits.jet.server)

;; Simple ping/pong server, will wait for PING, reply PONG and close connection
(run-jetty some-ring-handler
  {:port 8013
   :websockets {"/"
                (fn [{:keys [in out ctrl ws]
                      :as opts}]
                    (async/go
                      (when (= "PING" (async/<! in))
                        (async/>! out "PONG")
                        (async/close! out))))}})
```

The websocket client is used the same way

```clojure
(use 'qbits.jet.client.websocket)

;; Simple PING client to our server, sends PING, waits for PONG and
;; closes the connection
(connect! "ws://localhost:8013/"
          (fn [{:keys [in out ctrl ws]}]
            (async/go
              (async/>! out "PING")
              (when (= "PONG" (async/<! in))
                (async/close! out))))))
```

If you close the :out channel, the socket will be closed, this is true
for both client/server modes.


### HTTP Client

The API is nearly identical to clj-http and other clients for
clojure. One of the major difference is that calls to the client
return a channel that will receive the eventual response
asynchronously.  The response is then a fairly standard ring response
map, except the body, which is also a core.async channel (potential
streaming/chunked response support in the future).

See the docs for details,
[HTTP client API docs](http://mpenet.github.io/jet/qbits.jet.client.http.html)
[`qbits.jet.client.http/request`](http://mpenet.github.io/jet/qbits.jet.client.http.html#var-request)
in particular gives an idea of the format.


```clojure
(use 'qbits.jet.client.http)
(use 'clojure.core.async)

;; returns a chan
(http/get "http://graph.facebook.com/zuck")
user> #<ManyToManyChannel clojure.core.async.impl.channels.ManyToManyChannel@731db933>

;; block for the response
(<!! (http/get "http://graph.facebook.com/zuck"))

user> {:status 200,
       :headers
       {"content-type" "text/javascript; charset=UTF-8",
        "access-control-allow-origin" "*",
        "content-length" "173",
        "x-fb-debug"
        "jkc4w5S1VN3bLddmGEU+r3F/5ANxPZXrcqq3bUXJ3n2bwZq7WB0xy+mB/CziD56wHWd2us//p2dTmRQSIiW+Yg==",
        "facebook-api-version" "v1.0",
        "connection" "keep-alive",
        "pragma" "no-cache",
        "expires" "Sat, 01 Jan 2000 00:00:00 GMT",
        "x-fb-rev" "1358170",
        "etag" "\"3becf5f2bb7ec39daa6bb65345d40b9f4b1db483\"",
        "date" "Wed, 06 Aug 2014 15:51:02 GMT",
        "cache-control" "private, no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate"},
       :body
       #<ManyToManyChannel clojure.core.async.impl.channels.ManyToManyChannel@7ca698b0>}


;; get to the body
(-> (http/get "http://graph.facebook.com/zuck")
    <!!
    :body
    <!!)
user> "{\"id\":\"4\",\"first_name\":\"Mark\",\"gender\":\"male\",\"last_name\":\"Zuckerberg\",\"link\":\"https:\\/\\/www.facebook.com\\/zuck\",\"locale\":\"en_US\",\"name\":\"Mark Zuckerberg\",\"username\":\"zuck\"}"

;; autodecode the body
(-> (get "http://graph.facebook.com/zuck" {:as :json})
         async/<!!
         :body
         async/<!!)
user> {:id "4",
       :first_name "Mark",
       :gender "male",
       :last_name "Zuckerberg",
       :link "https://www.facebook.com/zuck",
       :locale "en_US",
       :name "Mark Zuckerberg",
       :username "zuck"}

;; POST
(post "http://foo.com" {:form-params {:foo "bar" :baz 1}})
```

And you can image (or read the api doc) how `post`, `put`, `delete`
and other methods work. It's fairly standard. All the "method"
functions are just api sugar around [`qbits.jet.client.http/request`](http://mpenet.github.io/jet/qbits.jet.client.http.html#var-request).


This is the easy way of using the Http Client, you can also go further
and take advantage of the fact that jetty9 client splits the client
and request part of the process. You can create/setup a single client
and use it for many requests.

To quote the Jetty9 documentation:

> HttpClient provides an efficient, asynchronous, non-blocking implementation to perform HTTP requests to a server through a simple API that offers also blocking semantic.
> HttpClient provides easy-to-use methods such as GET(String) that allow to perform HTTP requests in a one-liner, but also gives the ability to fine tune the configuration of requests via newRequest(URI).
> HttpClient acts as a central configuration point for network parameters (such as idle timeouts) and HTTP parameters (such as whether to follow redirects).
> HttpClient transparently pools connections to servers, but allows direct control of connections for cases where this is needed.
> HttpClient also acts as a central configuration point for cookies, via getCookieStore().


This is also accessible from clojure:
```clojure
(def c (client {...}))

(get "http://foo.com" {:client ...})
(get "http://foo.com/bar" {:client ...})

```
