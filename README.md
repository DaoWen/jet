# jet
<!-- [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/mpenet/jet.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/mpenet/jet) -->

Jet is a server + client library to interact/use jetty9 from clojure
using core.async channels.
The server is both a ring-adapter and has support for websocket, and
the client has yet to see the light of day.

The server part started from the code of the various
ring-jetty9-adapters existing.
