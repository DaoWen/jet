Jet is a server + clients library to interact/use jetty9 from clojure
using core.async channels.
The server is both a ring-adapter and has support for websocket
Clients support http and websocket, the websocket client and server
are used the same way from core.async (they actually share the same
socket abstraction).

The server part started from the code of the various
ring-jetty9-adapters existing.

The API is still subject to changes.

<!-- ## Documentation -->

<!-- [codox generated documentation](http://mpenet.github.com/jet/#docs). -->

## Installation

jet is [available on Clojars](https://clojars.org/cc.qbits/jet).

Add this to your dependencies:

## Example

Here we have the equivalent of a call to run-jetty, with the first
param as your main app ring handler (coming from whatever routing lib
you might use).

In the options the `:websockets` value takes a map of path to
handlers.

The websocket handlers receive a map that hold 3 core.async channels
and the underlying WebSocketAdapter instance for potential advanced uses.

* `ctrl` will receive status messages such as `[::connect this]`
`[::error e]` `[::close reason]`

* `in` will receive content sent by this connected client

* `out` will allow you to push content to this connected client

```clojure
(use 'qbits.jet.server)

(run some-ring-handler
  {:port 8013
   :websockets {"/foo/"
                (fn [{:keys [in out ctrl ws]
                      :as opts}]
                  (async/go
                    (loop []
                      (when-let [x (async/<! ctrl)]
                        (println :ctrl x ctrl)
                        (recur))))
                  (async/go
                    (loop []
                      (when-let [x (async/<! in)]
                        (println :recv x in)
                        (recur))))

                  (future (dotimes [i 3]
                            (async/>!! out (str "send " i))
                            (Thread/sleep 1000)))

                  ;; (close! ws)
                  )}})
```



The websocket client is used the same way

```clojure
(use 'qbits.jet.client.websocket)
(ws-client "ws://localhost:8013/foo/"
           (fn [{:keys [in out ctrl ws]}]
             (async/go
               (loop []
                 (when-let [x (async/<! ctrl)]
                   (println :client-ctrl x ctrl)
                   (recur))))

             (async/go
               (loop []
                 (when-let [x (async/<! in)]
                   (println :client-recv x in)
                   (recur))))

             (future (dotimes [i 3]
                       (async/>!! out (str "client send " (str "client-" i)))
                       (Thread/sleep 1000))))))
```

If you close the :out channel, the socket will be closed, this is true
for both client/server modes.
